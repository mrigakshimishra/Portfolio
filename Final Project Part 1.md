# Final Project: Part 1
## Background 

The final project involves the use of data such that it intervenes in the bigger story. Having worked in the healthcare industry previously I had witnessed how the experience for patients was often different based on their socioeconomic background. Thus, for the final project, I decided to work on this and dive deeper into the data that often gets overlooked especially when it comes to looking for a solution. 


## Topic 

The Cancer Mortality Gap: Disparities in Outcomes (In the United States)


## Project Outline 

What is the first thing that comes to our mind when we think of cancer? Perhaps, struggle, chemotherapy, excessive financial and physical burden on caregivers, struggle to cope, or even death sometimes. Most feelings can be tied back to a common theme - an extremely negative reaction, however, this isn't the same for everyone. We live in a world divided on several socio-economic factors that affect something as basic as access to healthcare often leading to unequal outcomes in most scenarios. While it is widely known that cancer survival rates vary based on these factors, my aim through this project is to go deeper by uncovering less obvious but critical factors, such as access to early diagnosis and systemic healthcare barriers. By visualizing these disparities and examining successful interventions, I aim to show how targeted healthcare programs can help close the survival gap.


## Project Setup (Based on The Good Charts Method)

**[Setup] Establishing Context:** The setup phase provides the necessary background and helps introduce the topic to the audience audience. At this stage, I want to frame the problem and get them hooked.
Visualization Idea: Using a bar chart showing the survival rate differences between various ethnic groups to establish that disparities exist.

**[Conflict] Introducing the Problem:** Next, I’ll dig deeper into the problem, focusing on the surprising or less obvious facts. This is where I aim to present the insight that leaves the audience thinking and curious for the next stage.
Visualization Idea: Heat map to highlight disparities based on geography, showing the detection for each cancer stage. 

**[Resolution] Showing the Path Forward:** The resolution is where I aim to bring closure to the story by showing the impact that certain interventions have. At this stage, I want to leave the audience with a sense of awareness and hope, knowing that the situation is not ideal however if each of us focuses on taking the right step in the right direction we will be able to see a drop in the number of cases.
Visualization Idea: For this phase, I will include before/after comparisons of regions that have successfully reduced disparities. Additionally, a side-by-side comparison chart might demonstrate the impact of early intervention and even policy changes.

## Initial Sketches 
## The Data 

**Data: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Cancer Registry** 

**Description:**  The data set contains the total number of cases by state, gender, and ethnic group. My goal is to use this data for the visualizations in the Setup phase. This data is useful in terms of setting up the background to get an understanding of the current state of case cases based on these demographics. 

*This data set currently does not show the data for certain states, the process for that is to apply through this [form](https://www.cdc.gov/united-states-cancer-statistics/public-use/pdf/uscs-public-use-database-request-form-fillable-508.pdf). I have applied for this and will get access to it within the next two days. 

**I'm not entirely sure about using this data set at this point since I'm yet to receive the access in the case that I do not I will be using the State Cancer profile for the Setup phase as well.

**Data: State Cancer Profile** 

**Description:**  The State Cancer Profile, breaks down the cancer state taking into consideration Demographics, Screening and Risk Factors, Incidence, and Mortality for each state, this data set is very rich and extremely helpful for the Conflict stage to present the data on late-stage cancer diagnoses and the screening rates.
*I might utilize this data set for the Setup phase as well.

**Data: Federal Programs That Support Cancer Prevention and Early Detection** 

**Description:**  This report by the National Institute of Health (NIH) provides details on all of the initiatives taken by the government, the states in which they were implemented and what was the impact of each of these changes. My goal is to utilize this data set for the resolution phase to highlight the impact of interventions such as early detection and screening.

## Method and Medium 

**Data Visualization- Tableau and Flourish:** For data visualizations, I will be focusing primarily on Tableau, however, having recently discovered Flourish it is something I would want to utilize for my final project given that it helps make data visualizations interactive thus helping with the storytelling too.

**Storytelling & Presentation- Shorthand:** Exploring Shorthand helped me get an understanding of how I would want the flow of my story to look and what aspects I can incorporate to better integrate the data sets I plan on using.

**Figma and Miro:** For creating graphics that support the storyline, especially in cases where something specific is needed and I'm not able to find those images due to limited options via the creative commons license. 

***Dashboard:*** *Since this is optional for now I would perhaps choose to explore this option and figure out if it is something viable for me given the limited time frame, if it works out for me I would be embedding it into shorthand itself as part of the storyline.*
