**Data Visualization- Tableau and Flourish:** For data visualizations, I will be focusing primarily on Tableau, however, having recently discovered Flourish it is something I would want to utilize for my final project given that it helps make data visualizations interactive thus helping with the storytelling too.

**Storytelling & Presentation- Shorthand:** Exploring Shorthand helped me get an understanding of how I would want the flow of my story to look and what aspects I can incorporate to better integrate the data sets I plan on using.

**Figma and Miro:** For creating graphics that support the storyline, especially in cases where something specific is needed and I'm not able to find those images due to limited options via the creative commons license. 

***Dashboard:*** *Since this is optional for now I would perhaps choose to explore this option and figure out if it is something viable for me given the limited time frame, if it works out for me I would be embedding it into shorthand itself as part of the storyline.*
