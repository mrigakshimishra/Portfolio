### Interview Findings 

|   | Participant 1  | Participant 2  |  Participant 3 | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   | _**24, Female, Student**_  | _**24, Male, Student**_  |  _**26, Female, Student**_ |   |
|   | It would help to use the same colors for all the graphs and charts. | The call-to-actions are somewhat vague.   |  More data points can be incorporated, to emphasize the importance of interventions.  |   |
|   | Since the focus is only on US, this should be mentioned somehow at the beginning.   | The flow of the story is good overall.  |  Some of the existing policies can be explored. |   |
|   | The line chart took a little longer to interpret.   | Focusing on both socioeconomic and geographical factors might be a little too much.   |  Call-to-actions did not particularly speak to the target audience.  |   |
|   | Specifying what section of the society comes in the 'underrepresented category'.  | Some colors were too light compared to the theme.    |  The language used can be made simpler- so that the target audience can understand quickly. |   |
|   | _"Starting with a figure was helpful in catching my attention."_  | _"The title for the graph is insightful."_  |  _"I didn't know there was so much of a gap."_ |   |
|   | _"I would want to know to know what I can do as a student with limited resources."_  | _"For some of the slides, the text is a little hard to read because of the color contrast."_  |  _"To make it more engaging, you can end with a question."_ |   |
