# About me
My name is Mrigakshi, and my pronouns are she/her. I’m currently a grad student at CMU studying Product Innovation. My course is interdisciplinary, combining elements of design, business, and technology. As a prospective product manager, I’m eager to explore how data can enhance decision-making.
# What I hope to learn 
Through this course, I aim to sharpen my skills in visualizing data and communicating insights effectively. I’m particularly interested in learning how to tailor data stories to different stakeholders, as this is a crucial skill for a Product Manager. Additionally, my goal is to enhance my ability to create data-driven insights that are not only informative but also actionable.

## Step 1: Finding a Data Visualization
For this assignment, the data set that I choose to work with is from an article published on Lifehacker, written by Beth Skwarecki, and the supporting Data Visualization was created by Brittany Rosenau. The data mentions and analyzes the various sources of protein available and contrasts their costs based on 30g of each source. I have spent significant time reading about how a healthy diet can often be very expensive to follow for the average consumer which piqued my initial interest in the article. Further, upon seeing the data visualization, I noticed that there are opportunities to make it easier to interpret without spending so much time inferring the data.

## Step 2: Critique The Visualization 
### Informative

**Usefulness**

When thinking of the intended audience which may include individuals such as professional trainers, dietitians, fitness enthusiasts, or budget-conscious families looking to optimize their protein intake cost-effectively, the information is highly relevant as the data has a twofold focus, emphasizing both cost and calories increasing allowing for a comprehensive approach to dietary planning that takes into account both economic and nutritional factors. The reason for giving it an 8 is considering that there is scope for improvement in terms of the visual design, the images for each source can be distracting, and eradicating this would make the data more direct and easier to comprehend. 

**Completeness**

Considering the evaluation based on completeness, the information is sufficient since the chart provides clear data on the cost and caloric content per 30 grams of protein for various food items, which is the core information needed for the stated purpose of comparing cost-effectiveness. It also covers a diverse range of protein sources, including plant-based options and animal-based options. However, where it lacks is in terms of providing enough relevant context. The chart does not include any comparative benchmarks, such as average costs, industry standards, or historical data, which could help frame the provided information more meaningfully and would significantly improve the user's ability to evaluate the information effectively. 

**Perceptibility**

For the purpose of the data represented here, the choice to use a bar chart is effective since the purpose is to compare quantities like cost across different categories. The images are distracting, as they introduce unnecessary visual complexity that doesn't contribute to understanding the data better. Removing pictures would allow for quicker visual processing and reduce cognitive load. Further, the hierarchy can be improved upon in regards to the title and the explanation below it. Having all of it in block letters adds unnecessary strain to the eyes. 

**Intuitiveness**

The bar chart is a widely used format for displaying comparative data, thus making it a good choice for a general audience. Improving intuitiveness could involve simplifying the visual design to focus more on the data itself, reducing the use of multiple images, and possibly including brief instructions or clearer labels that guide the viewer through the data more clearly. This would make the chart more accessible and easier to understand for a wider range of viewers.


### Emotive

**Aesthetics**

While the data is not necessarily ugly it lacks an overall aesthetic appeal to it which if enhanced could improve the visualization. There is an attempt to make the chart visually engaging, however its aesthetics can be perceived as too busy or lacking in professional polish. The use of various colors and images, although initially eye-catching, may ultimately serve more as a distraction than an enhancement. Improving the aesthetics could involve eliminating the use of food images, and focusing on a cleaner, more professional design that enhances the data's visibility and the viewer's ability to engage with the content without visual distractions. This would make the chart not only more pleasing but also potentially more effective at communicating its intended message.

**Engagement**

For an audience interested in nutritional or financial data, the chart’s subject matter is relevant, but maintaining engagement requires a straightforward and appealing presentation. The busy nature of the design may cause viewers to disengage once the initial visual interest fades, especially if they have to work hard to derive insights.
