# About me
My name is Mrigakshi, and my pronouns are she/her. I’m currently a grad student at CMU studying Product Innovation. My course is interdisciplinary, combining elements of design, business, and technology. As a prospective product manager, I’m eager to explore how data can enhance decision-making.
# What I hope to learn 
Through this course, I aim to sharpen my skills in visualizing data and communicating insights effectively. I’m particularly interested in learning how to tailor data stories to different stakeholders, as this is a crucial skill for a Product Manager. Additionally, my goal is to enhance my ability to create data-driven insights that are not only informative but also actionable.

## Step 1: Finding a Data Visualization
For this assignment, the data set that I choose to work with is from an article published on Lifehacker, written by Beth Skwarecki, and the supporting Data Visualization was created by Brittany Rosenau. The data mentions and analyzes the various sources of protein available and contrasts their costs based on certain weights of each. I have spent significant time reading about how a healthy diet can often be very expensive to follow for the average consumer which piqued my initial interest in the article. Further, upon seeing the data visualization, I noticed that there are opportunities to make it easier to interpret without spending so much time inferring the data.
