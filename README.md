# About me
My name is Mrigakshi, and my pronouns are she/her. I’m currently a grad student at CMU studying Product Innovation. My course is interdisciplinary, combining elements of design, business, and technology. As a prospective product manager, I’m eager to explore how data can enhance decision-making.
# What I hope to learn 
Through this course, I aim to sharpen my skills in visualizing data and communicating insights effectively. I’m particularly interested in learning how to tailor data stories to different stakeholders, as this is a crucial skill for a Product Manager. Additionally, my goal is to enhance my ability to create data-driven insights that are not only informative but also actionable.
